     * Crate a HashMap of Integers for the keys and Strings for the values.
     * Create a GUI with three buttons.
     * Button 1: Add Entry
     *      When this button is clicked, use an input dialog to ask the user
     *      to enter an ID number.
     *      After an ID is entered, use another input dialog to ask the user
     *      to enter a name. Add this information as a new entry to your
     *      HashMap.
     * 
     * Button 2: Search by ID
     *      When this button is clicked, use an input dialog to ask the user
     *      to enter an ID number.
     *      If that ID exists, display that name to the user.
     *      Otherwise, tell the user that that entry does not exist.
     * 
     * Button 3: View List
     *      When this button is clicked, display the entire list in a message
     *      dialog in the following format:
     *      ID: 123  Name: Harry Howard
     *      ID: 245  Name: Polly Powers
     *      ID: 433  Name: Oliver Ortega
     *      etc...
     * 
     * When this is complete, add a fourth button to your window.
     * Button 4: Remove Entry
     *      When this button is clicked, prompt the user to enter an ID using
     *      an input dialog.
     *      If this ID exists in the HashMap, remove it. Otherwise, notify the
     *      user that the ID is not in the list.
